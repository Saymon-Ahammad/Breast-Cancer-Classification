# Breast-Cancer-Classification

This project is a web-based deep learning application designed to classify breast cancer images as Cancer or Non-Cancer. The system utilizes a hybrid deep learning model, combining multiple pre-trained networks, which achieves an impressive accuracy of 99.33% in classifying breast tissue images.

**Key features include:**
**1. User-Friendly Web Interface:** Upload images directly through the browser and see an immediate live preview.
**2. Accurate Classification:** The hybrid model predicts whether the image shows Cancerous or Non-Cancerous tissue.
**3. Probability Visualization:** A horizontal bar chart shows prediction probabilities for each class.
**4. Persistent Preview:** The selected image remains visible after classification.
**5. Modern UI:** Clean, responsive interface for a smooth user experience.

**Technologies Used:**
Python (Flask) – Web server framework
TensorFlow / Keras – Deep learning for the hybrid model
Pillow (PIL) – Image preprocessing
Chart.js – Visualizing prediction probabilities
HTML/CSS/JavaScript – Front-end interface

This project can help healthcare professionals or students quickly screen breast tissue images, visualize prediction confidence, and support accurate decision-making in diagnostic processes.
